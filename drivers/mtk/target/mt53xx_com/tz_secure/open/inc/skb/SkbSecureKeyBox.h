/** @mainpage SKB API
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * 
 * The SKB (Secure Key Box) API provides a simple interface to a code 
 * module responsible for the handling of secret data, such as 
 * cryptographic keys. It enables the use of secret data without exposing 
 * this sensitive information to the calling application.
 * 
 * The processing environment for a device is considered to be divided 
 * into two domains: a secure domain in which all handling of secrets 
 * is done, and an open domain. The SKB API is the boundary between those 
 * domains. 
 * 
 * Code executing in the open domain (for example, an application running
 * on a general-purpose CPU) is often vulnerable to attacks, so it is risky 
 * for it to access secret data in the clear. With the SKB API, such code 
 * never needs to directly access secret data. Instead, the SKB API 
 * implementation, executing in a security processor or otherwise secure 
 * environment, can be responsible for all secrets. Code in the open domain 
 * can simply invoke SKB API interfaces to ask the code executing in the 
 * secure domain to manage secret data and perform operations on it.
 * 
 * @section algorithms Cryptographic Algorithms
 *
 * The SKB API exposes common cryptographic methods to encrypt/decrypt, 
 * sign/verify, and digest data (possibly including secret data). The SKB 
 * implementation supports the following cryptographic algorithms:
 * 
 *    - RSA 1.5 encryption/decryption, sign/verify
 *    - RSA OAEP encryption/decryption
 *    - AES 128-bit encryption/decryption in ECB, CBC, or CTR mode
 *    - SHA-1, and SHA-256 digests
 *    - HMAC signatures
 * 
 * @section other_operations Other Operations
 * 
 * The API also provides a mechanism to unwrap a cryptographically wrapped 
 * key (a key encrypted with another key) and then to use the key in 
 * cryptographic operations.
 * 
 * Applications can also ask the API to export secret data, that is, 
 * provide a protected form of the secret data that the caller can store 
 * in non-secure persistent storage. When needed later, the data can be 
 * returned to its original form (in the secret domain) so that it can 
 * be used in further operations.
 * 
 * @section getting_started Getting Started
 * 
 * The interface to the SKB is a C interface, composed of a number of object 
 * classes. Even though the interface is an ANSI C interface, it adopts an 
 * object-oriented style. The header file declares object classes. An object 
 * class defines the functional interface to the class (a set of methods). 
 * Each method of a class interface is a function whose first argument is a 
 * reference to an instance of the same class. The data type that represents 
 * references to object instances is a pointer to an opaque C struct. It may 
 * be considered as analogous to a pointer to a C++ object. 
 * 
 * @section example Example
 * 
 * A concrete example is that for the class named SKB_Cipher, the data type 
 * SKB_Cipher is the name of a C struct. The function name for one of the 
 * methods of SKB_Cipher is SKB_Cipher_ProcessBuffer(), and the function 
 * takes an SKB_Cipher* as its first parameter. 
 * 
 * @section instances Obtaining Class Instances
 * 
 * An instance of a class is obtained by declaring a pointer to an object 
 * for the class and passing the address of that pointer to a particular 
 * function. The function creates the instance and sets the pointer to refer 
 * to it.
 * 
 * For example, the first object that you need to create when you are going 
 * to use the SKB API is an SKB_Engine. An SKB_Engine object represents an 
 * instance of an engine that can manage and operate on secret data. An 
 * SKB_Engine instance is obtained by calling SKB_Engine_GetInstance(), which 
 * is declared as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   SKB_Result SKB_Engine_GetInstance(SKB_Engine** engine);</pre>
 * As you can see, the parameter is the address of an SKB_Engine pointer. 
 * This  method creates an SKB_Engine instance, and sets the pointer to refer to 
 * the new instance. Here is a sample call:
 * <pre>
 *   SKB_Engine* engine = NULL;
 *   SKB_Result result;
 *   result = SKB_Engine_GetInstance(&engine);</pre>
 * @section method_calls Making Method Calls
 * 
 * In the C object-oriented style for the API, a call to a method of a 
 * particular instance is done by calling a function and passing a pointer to 
 * the instance as the first parameter.
 * 
 * For example, once an SKB_Engine instance is created, as shown in the previous 
 * section, all the SKB_Engine methods can be called to operate on that instance. 
 * One such method is the SKB_Engine_GetInfo() method, which is used to obtain 
 * information about the engine (version numbers, properties, and so on). This 
 * method is declared as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     SKB_Result SKB_Engine_GetInfo(const SKB_Engine* self, SKB_EngineInfo* info);</pre>
 * 
 * This method stores the engine information in the SKB_EngineInfo structure 
 * pointed to by the info parameter. Assuming engine is the pointer previously 
 * set by SKB_Engine_GetInstance() to refer to the SKB_Engine instance it created, 
 * SKB_Engine_GetInfo() can be invoked by the following:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     SKB_Result result;
 *     SKB_EngineInfo engineInfo;
 *     result = SKB_Engine_GetInfo(engine, &engineInfo);</pre>
 * 
 * @section header_file Header File
 * 
 * The file SkbSecureKeyBox.h contains the entire SKB API interface. 
 * 
 * @section classes Main Classes
 * 
 * As mentioned above, the first object you should instantiate is an SKB_Engine. 
 * All other class instances are instantiated by calling SKB_Engine methods.
 * 
 * The primary abstractions exposed by the API are the SKB_SecureData, 
 * SKB_Transform, and SKB_Cipher classes. 
 * 
 * The SKB_SecureData object represents secret data. It allows an application 
 * to refer to and operate on data managed by the SKB. Some SKB_SecureData 
 * objects are named, so that a calling application can locate a specific 
 * secret within the SKB. For example, each device is considered to have a 
 * well-guarded secret device key. It is a key that is sufficiently protected 
 * so as to act as a root of trust used to enable the secure marshaling of 
 * other keys and credentials into the Secure Key Box. An application can 
 * ask the SKB_Engine to create an SKB_SecureData object referencing the 
 * device key. It asks for this key by name (TBD).
 * 
 * An SKB_SecureData object is created for each (usually secret) data item 
 * to be operated on by the SKB. To create an SKB_SecureData object, call an
 * appropriate SKB_Engine method. For example, SKB_Engine_CreateDataFromWrapped() 
 * creates an SKB_SecureData object representing the data resulting from 
 * unwrapping (decrypting) specified wrapped data.
 * 
 * An SKB_Transform is used to perform operations on data, such as digest 
 * calculations. It returns the output to the caller. Due to the nature of 
 * the transforms available, the output does not expose any secret data. 
 * You create an SKB_Transform by calling the SKB_Engine_CreateTransform() method.
 * 
 * An SKB_Cipher object encapsulates the attributes and parameters necessary to 
 * perform cryptographic operations on SKB_SecureData objects. You create an 
 * SKB_Cipher by calling the SKB_Engine_CreateCipher() method.
 * 
 * @section return_values Method Return Values
 * 
 * As you can see from the examples above, most SKB API methods return an 
 * SKB_Result. 
 * 
 * An SKB_Result is an int, and its possible values are defined in 
 * SkbSecureKeyBox.h. When a method call succeeds, the return value is 
 * SKB_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it is a negative number.
 *  * 
 * @section conventions Conventions for Functions Returning Output in Variable-length Buffer
 * 
 * A number of the functions defined in the SKB API return a variable amount of output 
 * in a buffer provided by the caller. The output is returned in a variable-length 
 * application-supplied buffer. An example of a function of this sort is 
 * SKB_Transform_GetOutput().
 * 
 * These functions have some common calling conventions, which we describe here. Two of 
 * the arguments to the function are a pointer to the output buffer (say 'output') 
 * and a pointer to a location which will hold the length of the output produced 
 * (say 'output_size'). There are two ways for an application to call such a function:
 * 
 *         - If output is NULL, then all that the function does is return (in *output_size)
 * a number of bytes which would suffice to hold the output produced by the function. 
 * This number may somewhat exceed the precise number of bytes needed, but should not 
 * exceed it by a large amount. SKB_SUCCESS is returned by the function. 
 * 
 *         - If output is not NULL, then *output_size must contain the size in bytes 
 * of the buffer pointed to by 'output'. If that buffer is large enough to hold 
 * the output produced by the function, then that output is placed there, and 
 * SKB_SUCCESS is returned by the function. If the buffer is not large enough, 
 * then SKB_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned. In either case, *output_size is 
 * set to hold the exact number of bytes of output produced by the function.
 * 
 * @section thread_model Thread Model
 * 
 * An engine (SKB_Engine_GetInstance) and any object or data obtained directly or 
 * indirectly from this engine may only be accessed from the same thread 
 * as the one on which the engine was obtained. Multiple threads can each 
 * use different engines, but engines cannot be passed or shared between 
 * threads. If an instance of an SKB_SecureData object needs to be transfered 
 * from one engine to another, the SKB_SecureData_Export method can be used 
 * with the 'target 'parameter set to SKB_EXPORT_TARGET_CROSS_ENGINE, and 
 * the exported buffer can be loaded in a different engine by calling 
 * SKB_Engine_CreateDataFromExported().
